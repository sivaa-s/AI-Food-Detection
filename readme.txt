🍽️ AI Food Ingredient Recognition
A Python-based AI model to detect ingredients from food images.

🚀 Overview
This project leverages AI and machine learning to analyze images of food and identify their ingredients with high accuracy.

🔧 How It Works
The program takes image inputs defined in a JSON file.
It processes the image using computer vision models.
The AI predicts the most probable ingredient along with its confidence score.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: Python
Machine Learning: OpenCV, TensorFlow/PyTorch
Data Handling: JSON, NumPy, Pandas
Deployment: AWS (optional)

📌 Usage
Modify the input.json file with the desired image paths.
Run the main.py file:

The program will return the top ingredient prediction along with its probability score.

Example Output:

Predicted Ingredient: Tomato 🍅  
Confidence Score: 92.5%  

🚀 Future Improvements
✅ Improve accuracy with a larger dataset
✅ Implement multi-ingredient detection
✅ Add a web interface for easy image uploads
